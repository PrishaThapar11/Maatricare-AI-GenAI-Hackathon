🌸 MaatriCare AI
An Intelligent Maternal Health Copilot for ASHA Workers

MaatriCare AI equips ASHA workers with early risk detection, explainable AI guidance, and timely escalation support, transforming fragmented maternal health data into clear, field-ready decisions.

🚨 Problem Statement

Despite improvements in maternal healthcare, preventable complications remain high in rural India.

ASHA workers often face the following challenges:

Managing multiple pregnancies with limited decision support

Manual interpretation of vitals and medical reports

Generic care guidance that ignores region, season, and food availability

Delayed escalation of high-risk cases

The issue is not intent or effort — it is the absence of real-time, explainable decision intelligence at the community level.
